# Home-security-system

### Project Overview: 
For ensuring home security,we use two sensors, LDR sensor and sound sensor. In the absence of the house owner, our sensors detects unwanted presence. When the room is supposed to be dark, if anybody lit any light or makes any sound, our LDR sensor detects that light and sound sensor detects sound. After that, it turns the alarm system ON. This is how our system ensures house security. We make the circuit by using Proteus. We show the output data in a table and waveform in Labview GUI.
